## 2. Data Collection and Use
The App does not collect, store, or share any personal data, usage data, or any other type of data.
All interactions occur solely on your device.

## 3. No Network Connections
The App functions entirely offline, meaning it does not connect to the internet, external servers,

such changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.
